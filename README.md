## Gut microbiota fuels HCC development by shaping the hepatic inflammatory microenvironment

### Abstract
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide and therapeutic options for advanced HCC are limited. Here, we discovered that intestinal dysbiosis affects antitumor immune surveillance and drives liver disease progression towards cancer. Dysbiotic microbiota as seen in Nlrp6-/- mice induced a Toll-like receptor 4 dependent expansion of hepatic monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mMDSC) and suppression of T-cell abundance. This phenotype was transmissible via fecal microbiota transfer and reversible upon microbiota depletion, pointing to the high plasticity of the tumor microenvironment. While loss of Akkermansia muciniphila correlated with mMDSC abundance, its transfer restored intestinal barrier function and strongly reduced steatohepatitis activity. Cirrhosis patients displayed increased hepatic tissue microbiota, which induced pronounced transcriptional changes including activation of fibro-inflammatory pathways as well as circuits mediating cancer immunosuppression. This study demonstrates that gut microbiota closely shape the hepatic inflammatory microenvironment defining new approaches for cancer prevention and therapy.
