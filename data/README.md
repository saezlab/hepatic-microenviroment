## Data
The `data` folder is with a few exceptions _read only_. Count matrix of the patient cohort must be placed here. In order to run the analysis pipeline smoothly the count matrix file should be tab delimited and named `Trautwein_human-rawdata.txt`.

In oder to retrieve futher required meta data in a proper format please run all the R scripts in this directory.
